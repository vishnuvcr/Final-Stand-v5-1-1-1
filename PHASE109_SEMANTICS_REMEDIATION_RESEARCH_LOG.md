# Phase 109 semantic remediation research log

## 2026-10-12 — Source audit
- Read current Phase 109 plan, status, research/error/chat logs, evaluator/workflow, shard summary/progress and source-feasibility reports before editing.
- Parent evaluator run [38216687089](https://github.com/vishnuvcr/Final-Stand-v5-1-1-1/actions/runs/38216687089) completed successfully, and its automatic continuation [run 38219270449](https://github.com/vishnuvcr/Final-Stand-v5-1-1-1/actions/runs/38219270449) was observed in progress during resume.
- The latest parent v1 published checkpoint is two completed ranges: 4,000 configurations, 96,000 cost rows, 590,000 remaining. That is workflow progress, not a profitability conclusion.
- Static review discovered name-substring fallback, invalid cross-asset confirmation semantics, undefined target state for realised-volatility regimes, EMA slope aliasing and lack of a crossing condition for EMA crossover.
- Opened an isolated branch so the parent workflow and published checkpoint remain preserved.
- V2 exact allowlist, semantic tests and engine-version cursor reset are implemented; actual Actions execution and empirical metrics are not yet verified.
- Transaction-cost assumptions remain 24 scenarios; OHLC fills are execution proxies; no strategy is promoted.
