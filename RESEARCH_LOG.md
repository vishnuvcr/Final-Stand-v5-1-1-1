# Research Log — main branch

## 2026-10-03 — Phase 20 isolated runner trigger
- Added a temporary main-branch execution bridge that checks out only `phase-20-payoff-boundary-stop-research`, executes the pre-registered boundary-stop research, and persists outputs back to that phase branch.
- The strategy code and research artifacts remain isolated on the Phase-20 branch.
- Phase history and detailed step logs continue on the phase branch.

## 2026-10-03 — Phase 20 optimized execution trigger
- Optimized Phase 20 to reuse the locked 190-trade ledger and NIFTY spot file, loading option files only for expiry dates capable of breaching the entry payoff boundary.
- Corrected strike-column access in the option-path reconstruction before triggering the run.

## 2026-10-03 — Main-branch Phase 20 final status
- Phase 20 payoff-boundary research completed on isolated branch `phase-20-payoff-boundary-stop-research`.
- Boundary-stop family rejected after negative validation and 2026 holdout results.
- Final historical exit rule: target → 13:30 expiry-day negative-MTM/MFE<0.50×target stop → 15:29 expiry fallback.
- Final historical result: ₹149,129.53 net P&L across 190 trades; 179/190 positive net trades; 5 conditional stops; 0 baseline-positive trades stopped.
- Canonical final rules: https://github.com/vishnuvcr/Final-Stand-v5-1-1-1/blob/phase-20-payoff-boundary-stop-research/FINAL_STRATEGY_RULES.md
- Detailed Phase 20 log, errors and artifacts remain on the isolated research branch.


## Final research closeout — 2026-10-03
- Phase 23 complete; no OOS strategy adjustment promoted.
- Phase 24 complete; no reversal trigger promoted.
- Final strategy remains the Phase-20 canonical dynamic-n specification.
- Final manuscript and evidence package are retained on branch phase-24-targeted-reversal-trigger.
