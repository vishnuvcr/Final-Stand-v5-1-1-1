# Phase 32 Status

## Current state
**PHASE 32 INITIALIZED — numerical backtest not yet executed**

### Step 1 — repository/phase audit
- Confirmed repository: vishnuvcr/Final-Stand-v5-1-1-1
- Confirmed prior phases through Phase 31 exist as separate branches.
- Confirmed Phase 31 is complete/rejected and Phase 20 remains canonical.
- Confirmed Phase 31 used the corrected dynamic-n research dependencies and successful GitHub Actions execution.
- Confirmed this strategy is materially different from the prior delta-exit research and is therefore isolated as a new phase.

### Step 2 — branch creation
- Created branch: phase-32-continuous-delta-6x6-backtest
- Base: Phase 31 successful head.
- No prior research result has been modified.

### Step 3 — frozen specification
- Added PHASE32_RESEARCH_PLAN.md.
- Added PHASE32_PRE_REGISTRATION.md.
- Added PHASE32_STRATEGY_SPEC.md.

### Numerical execution
**First CI execution failed before numerical execution due to missing NumPy dependency. Correction in progress.**

### Errors
- The first local file-write wrapper attempt failed due to JavaScript quoting syntax; it was corrected before repository evidence was accepted.
- The error is recorded in `ERROR_LOG.md`.

- CI run 37380393437 failed before numerical execution: NumPy was absent from the runner.
- The push-triggered workflow also exposed empty optional input environment variables; the script is being hardened to use defaults.

### Next registered phase step
Implement and audit the continuous trade state machine, then run the Phase-32 GitHub Actions workflow. Do not change the frozen strategy after observing numerical results.
