### Error F36-001 — Mixed skip-ledger row widths
**Affected jobs:** CATBOOST, WAVELET_TREE, OOF_STACK.

**Symptom:** The numerical loop completed many expiry calculations, then Pandas failed constructing the skip DataFrame with:
\`ValueError: 3 columns passed, passed data had 4 columns\`.

**Cause:** Missing/incomplete expiry skips were stored as three fields, while \`run_expiry()\` returned three fields that were prefixed with expiry, producing four fields.

**Evidence status:** The affected jobs are non-evidence. No conclusion or promotion decision uses them.

**Correction:** Normalize all skip records to the fixed schema \`expiry, timestamp, reason, detail\` before constructing the DataFrame.

**Prevention:** Enforce a single audit-record schema at the engine boundary and validate row widths before serialization.

**Research impact:** None on accepted evidence; failure occurred after the trade calculation loop and before final artifact creation.
