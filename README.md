## Latest research status

**Dynamic-n corrected primary research is complete. Stop-loss research is complete through Phase 19.**

### Locked dynamic-n primary

- 190 trades
- Net P&L: **₹138,937.12**
- Net win rate: **94.21%**
- 178 target exits
- 12 expiry exits
- 11 losing trades, all expiry exits
- Maximum drawdown: **₹27,321.08**

Controlled n-selection ablation showed that the 95%-band dynamic-n preference did **not** add incremental aggregate P&L versus fixed n=6 on the same trade universe: fixed n=6 returned ₹139,543.97 versus ₹138,937.12 for dynamic n.

### Stop-loss research

Phase 17 tested 108 pre-registered hard, expiry-day, stagnation, trailing and combined stop rules. No rule both preserved all baseline-positive trades and improved validation P&L.

Phase 18 and Phase 19 tested a narrower expiry-day conditional stop. The final **research candidate for paper/forward validation** is:

> **At 13:30 IST on expiry day, exit all three legs when combined strategy MTM is negative and running MFE since entry is below 0.50 × the original target.**

Walk-forward results for this candidate:

| Period | Net uplift | Baseline-positive trades affected | Stops |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Training through 2023-12-31 | +₹1,963.67 | 0 | 1 |
| Validation 2024-01-01 to 2025-12-31 | +₹1,923.59 | 0 | 2 |
| Holdout 2026-01-01 to 2026-09-30 | +₹6,305.15 | 0 | 2 |
| Full sample | +₹10,192.41 | 0 | 5 |

The candidate changes five exits, all baseline losing trades, and leaves every historically profitable baseline trade untouched. It does **not** eliminate any loss completely; it truncates selected expiry losses earlier.

The formal train-selected 13:30 / MFE < 1.0× rule was **not promoted** because its 2026 holdout maximum drawdown increased materially. The 0.50× version is retained as the more conservative robustness candidate.

The no-stop dynamic-n strategy remains the locked primary until the stop candidate is tested with forward/paper execution and real broker fills.

## Research governance

All previous superseded dynamic-n numerical results remain marked as obsolete. Execution errors and corrections are logged in `ERROR_LOG.md`; research-phase progress is tracked in `RESEARCH_LOG.md`; the research protocol is maintained in `DYNAMIC_N_RESEARCH_PLAN.md`.

**Phase 19 is the final stop-loss research phase under the current plan.**


## Latest completed phase — Phase 20

Phase 20 compared entry-time payoff-chart/green-area boundary stops against the fixed expiry-day conditional stop.

The boundary family tested 0/50/100/200/400 NIFTY-point buffers, 1/3-minute confirmation, and boundary/MTM/MFE variants. The training-safe selector was 400 points with 1-minute confirmation, but it lost **₹14,390.87** in 2024–2025 validation and **₹49,064.48** in the 2026 holdout, while materially worsening drawdown. Therefore **no payoff-boundary stop is included**.

The fixed Phase-19 comparator was independently reconstructed and cross-checked:
- 13:30 IST on expiry day;
- combined three-leg MTM < ₹0;
- running MFE < 0.50× original target.

Walk-forward uplift: +₹1,963.67 training, +₹1,923.59 validation, +₹6,305.15 holdout, +₹10,192.41 full sample, with zero baseline-positive trades affected.

### Final entry-to-exit rules

The final historical rules are recorded on the Phase-20 branch:

- [Final strategy specification](https://github.com/vishnuvcr/Final-Stand-v5-1-1-1/blob/phase-20-payoff-boundary-stop-research/STRATEGY_SPEC.md)
- [Phase 20 supplement](https://github.com/vishnuvcr/Final-Stand-v5-1-1-1/blob/phase-20-payoff-boundary-stop-research/manuscript/PHASE20_PAYOFF_BOUNDARY_SUPPLEMENT.md)

Final historical result over 190 corrected trades:
- Net P&L: **₹149,129.53**
- Mean net/trade: **₹784.89**
- Net winning trades: **179/190 (94.21%)**
- Profit factor: **2.34**
- Maximum cumulative drawdown: **₹27,336.11**
- Target exits: **178**
- Conditional-stop exits: **5**
- Expiry-fallback exits: **7**

This is historical research evidence, not a guarantee of future or live performance. Forward/paper execution validation remains separate from the historical research.

## Phase 21 status — pre-expiry risk-control research

Phase 21 is being evaluated on isolated branch `phase-21-pre-expiry-adverse-move-risk-control`. It tests bounded early exits and one-lot OTM-(n+3) tail-hedge repairs against the frozen Phase-20 strategy. The canonical strategy remains unchanged unless the pre-registered walk-forward promotion screen is passed.


## Phase 21 final status — pre-expiry adverse-move control

Phase 21 is complete. The pre-registered 200–600 point direction-aware early-exit and one-lot OTM-(n+3) hedge families produced **no candidate that satisfied the training safety constraint of zero profitable baseline trades affected**. The closest candidate (600-point / 1-minute / spot-only early exit) improved training by ₹1,885.47 but lost ₹33,923.36 in 2024–2025 validation and ₹44,039.53 in the 2026 holdout, while full-sample maximum drawdown rose to ₹52,740.01. **No Phase-21 rule is promoted; the Phase-20 final strategy remains the canonical historical specification.**

Phase-21 research files are isolated on branch `phase-21-pre-expiry-adverse-move-risk-control` and draft PR #2.


## Phase 23 final status — entry-filter research

Phase 23 tested BULLISH-only entry filters after Phase 22 found that all 11 historical losses were in the BULLISH/put structure, while all 18 BEARISH/call trades were profitable. The BULLISH subgroup also contained 161 winners, and no pre-registered BULLISH-only filter could remove at least two training losses while retaining 95% of winners and improving training P&L. The top unconstrained diagnostic (BULLISH direction margin ≥ 0.15) removed 12 winners and only 1 loss and was strongly negative out of sample. **No entry filter is promoted; the Phase-20 strategy remains canonical.**

Phase 23 artifacts are isolated on branch `phase-23-conditional-bullish-entry-filter` and draft PR #4.

## Phase 22 final status — entry-filter research

Phase 22 tested pre-entry filters using payoff-buffer geometry, direction confidence, structure quality and pre-entry NIFTY regime. **No candidate passed the pre-registered safety screen.** No tested filter removed even one training loss without also removing a profitable training trade. The Phase-20 canonical strategy therefore remains unchanged.

See the Phase-22 draft PR and branch for the complete grid and manuscript supplement.


## Final research closeout — Phase 24 complete

The preregistered research phases are complete. Phase 23 and Phase 24 did not produce an out-of-sample improvement that passed the registered promotion gates. The **Phase-20 canonical dynamic-n strategy remains the final historical entry-to-exit specification**.

Final historical result: **190 trades, ₹149,129.53 net P&L, 179/190 profitable trades (94.21%), profit factor 2.34, maximum drawdown ₹27,336.11** under the research execution-cost model.

## Phase 25 — alternative direction chooser

Phase 25 tested alternative option-price, IV, OI/volume, NIFTY and cross-market direction choosers while holding the rest of the final strategy fixed. **No alternative passed the preregistered training/OOS gates; OTM6/7/8 remains the direction chooser.**

## Phase 27 — Delta-based exit research — COMPLETE

Phase 27 tested portfolio-delta-based profit booking and adverse-delta stops against the locked Phase-20 strategy. Delta coverage was **99.21%**. The training-selected rule (MTM ≥ 0.90×target and |portfolio delta| ≤ 0.05) produced **−₹2,334.04** validation uplift and **−₹1,108.04** 2026 holdout uplift. The holdout bootstrap 95% CI for mean trade-level uplift was **−₹141.92 to −₹13.82**. **No delta exit is promoted; Phase-20 remains canonical.**

## Phase 28 — individual-leg delta research — COMPLETE

Phase 28 directly tested **per-leg delta**, especially the short OTM-(n+1) and OTM-(n+2) legs, rather than portfolio delta. The Phase-20 strategy remained frozen as control.

- Delta coverage: **99.21%**.
- Training-selected rule: S1 |delta| ≤ 0.05 after MTM ≥ 90% of target.
- Training uplift: **−₹2,998.16**.
- 2024–2025 validation uplift: **−₹2,487.05**.
- 2026 holdout uplift: **−₹35.91**.
- Full-sample uplift: **−₹5,521.12**.
- No adverse short-leg delta stop was promoted.

**Decision: reject individual-leg absolute-delta exit rules. Phase-20 remains canonical.**
