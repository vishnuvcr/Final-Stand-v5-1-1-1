## Latest research status

**Dynamic-n corrected primary research is complete. Stop-loss research is complete through Phase 19.**

### Locked dynamic-n primary

- 190 trades
- Net P&L: **₹138,937.12**
- Net win rate: **94.21%**
- 178 target exits
- 12 expiry exits
- 11 losing trades, all expiry exits
- Maximum drawdown: **₹27,321.08**

Controlled n-selection ablation showed that the 95%-band dynamic-n preference did **not** add incremental aggregate P&L versus fixed n=6 on the same trade universe: fixed n=6 returned ₹139,543.97 versus ₹138,937.12 for dynamic n.

### Stop-loss research

Phase 17 tested 108 pre-registered hard, expiry-day, stagnation, trailing and combined stop rules. No rule both preserved all baseline-positive trades and improved validation P&L.

Phase 18 and Phase 19 tested a narrower expiry-day conditional stop. The final **research candidate for paper/forward validation** is:

> **At 13:30 IST on expiry day, exit all three legs when combined strategy MTM is negative and running MFE since entry is below 0.50 × the original target.**

Walk-forward results for this candidate:

| Period | Net uplift | Baseline-positive trades affected | Stops |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Training through 2023-12-31 | +₹1,963.67 | 0 | 1 |
| Validation 2024-01-01 to 2025-12-31 | +₹1,923.59 | 0 | 2 |
| Holdout 2026-01-01 to 2026-09-30 | +₹6,305.15 | 0 | 2 |
| Full sample | +₹10,192.41 | 0 | 5 |

The candidate changes five exits, all baseline losing trades, and leaves every historically profitable baseline trade untouched. It does **not** eliminate any loss completely; it truncates selected expiry losses earlier.

The formal train-selected 13:30 / MFE < 1.0× rule was **not promoted** because its 2026 holdout maximum drawdown increased materially. The 0.50× version is retained as the more conservative robustness candidate.

The no-stop dynamic-n strategy remains the locked primary until the stop candidate is tested with forward/paper execution and real broker fills.

## Research governance

All previous superseded dynamic-n numerical results remain marked as obsolete. Execution errors and corrections are logged in `ERROR_LOG.md`; research-phase progress is tracked in `RESEARCH_LOG.md`; the research protocol is maintained in `DYNAMIC_N_RESEARCH_PLAN.md`.

**Phase 19 is the final stop-loss research phase under the current plan.**
